    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to assess several sets of skills that are required for Staff Reservoir Engineer & Staff Geologist roles at Biota.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "* Each section contains its own set of questions which should be answered to the best of your ability\n",
    "* Completing the Statistic and Resevoir Engineering / Geology questions are required. Unix and GitHub questions are bonus questions. \n",
    "* If the answer to a question is not known to you currently, state that you have not seen that command or usage before. Then search the internet for the answer and provide it to your best ability.\n",
    "* If you cannot answer a question, provide a list of your thought processes, and what you tried along the way. This is important for Biota since we often want to accomplish the right thing, but may need help on the execution. This is materially different from not knowing what the most appropriate thing to do is in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages:\n",
    "* This evaluation should be completable with only the basic packages listed below. If you find yourself needing different packages, please install them and note what and why you are using something specifically."
